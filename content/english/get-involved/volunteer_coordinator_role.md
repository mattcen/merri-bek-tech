title: "Short term paid role: Volunteer Coordinator"
---

Thanks to a grant from Merri-bek City Council, Merri-bek Tech would like to hire a volunteer coordinator for a short stint of approximately thirty hours work.

We're running our [2024 Winter Cohort](/get-involved/cohort1/) of volunteers soon, and we'd love you to help us maker sure that:

* We can find 12 volunteers who have an interest in learning tech skills and building local resilience, but come from a range of background with less access to existing forms of tech education, and;
* Our volunteers have everything they need to be set up for success with the program.

To achieve this, you'll have roots in local communities in Merri-bek, and be able to contribute ideas and action to promote our volunteer cohort into communities less well represented in tech, possibly including reaching recent migrants, refugees, Aboriginal and Torres Straight Islander communities, economically disadvantaged or underemployed people, and other groups who could benefit from this program.

This is not fundamentally a promotions role though, and it's key to us that our potential and selected volunteers receive good communication from us and have a safe and positive experience with the program. As such, the bulk of your role will be shaping volunteer experience - augmenting the role provided by our technical mentors by handling the bulk of initial communication with new volunteers, providing a safe person to talk to, and proactively ensuring that their needs are met.

To achieve this, facilitation and coordination experience is helpful, but not as important as lived experience working in community with people from a diverse array of backgrounds. If you think that this could be you, please reach out to us at [jobs@merri-bek.tech](mailto:jobs@merri-bek.tech) with some information about your relevant skills.

Pay for this role is about $1,000 in total, or 30 hours at $30 per hour. Ideally this would be a fixed term contract position and you would have an ABN. Given that this is a small role, it's important to us that it doesn't use too much of your time in applying for the role, or getting paid, and we're happy to discuss what we can do to make working with us easier.
